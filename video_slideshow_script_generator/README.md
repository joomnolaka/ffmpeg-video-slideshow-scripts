`colorchannelmixer=.3:.4:.3:0:.3:.4:.3:0:.3:.4:.3` = Convert input to grayscale

`boxblur=10:4` = Apply blur effect

## 5. Example

Below you can see the video created for the `example.vssg` slideshow.

## 6. Known Issues

- `Collapse Circular`, `Expand Circular`, `Fade In Two`, `Rotate`, `Sliding Bars` and `Spin Blur Rotation` transitions
require alpha channel. If your input file type does not support alpha channel then these transitions will not work 
as expected. You can overcome this situation by specifying `format=rgba` as input filter for input files connected to 
those transitions.

- Transitions supporting bar count require bar count to be defined according to the following rule.

  `On horizontal transitions 'height/(bar count)', on vertical transitions 'width/(bar count)' should be even. If not, horizontal/vertical lines may appear during the transition.`

- You can see the following messages if you enable audio in your slideshows. 
They are for informational purposes only and do not cause any errors.

  > [Parsed_amerge_128 @ 0x7ffca1c7d440] No channel layout for input 1
  > [Parsed_amerge_128 @ 0x7ffca1c7d440] Input channel layouts overlap: output layout will be determined by the number of distinct input channels

- If the sum of transition durations for a video is equal or bigger than the video duration then your script fill fail 
with the following error. You need to review transition durations and decrease if necessary.

  > Assertion start_sample < end_sample || (start_sample == end_sample && !frame->nb_samples) failed at libavfilter/trim.c:303

## 7. Tips

#### Memory 

- Scripts can consume too much memory depending on your input file count and characteristics. 
If you experience memory issues, split your images/videos into two or more smaller sets, create partial videos for 
each set and concatenate them in a new slideshow.
